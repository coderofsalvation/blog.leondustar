title: moving studio!

Currently Im moving my studio to Budapest by postmail. Im really excited since I put all my stuff into big boxes. This is the first time and I really can't wait to get my studio up and running here :)


Im in the middle of my albummaking so I hope I can continue this soon :)

> UPDATE: it seems my yamaha rm1x suffered some damage. Lesson learned: never send gear by mail, even if its insured and packed well. Not worth it.
