Here's the recording of a liveset i did in Budapest/Hungary.
I hope you feeling the funk, and I want to especially thank Roland And Katalyn for making this possible.

The liveset and beats were made in 1 week, hence the rawness and glitches of the liveset). 

## No tracktitles

Oh and ofcoarse there are not tracktitles, because the tracks just 'playfully happened' in the moment, just like with all good things in live :)

May the funk be with all of you.
