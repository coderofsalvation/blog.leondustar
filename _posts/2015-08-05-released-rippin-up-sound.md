title: released rippin up sound!
---

Its a fact!
My track 'rippin up sound' was released on my own record label `Du Star Funk`.
Its available at several online stores like [beatport](https://pro.beatport.com/track/rippin-up-sound-extended-version/6988160), [itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/rippin-up-sound-single/id1023600905), [spotify](https://play.spotify.com/artist/2y18VA8obpZTu6P3psRBIr?play=true&utm_source=open.spotify.com&utm_medium=open) and [other exotic platforms](http://www.amazon.co.jp/Rippin-up-Sound-Leon-Star/dp/B012UVWSHE).

This song was mostly made with the awesome free [buze](http://batman.no/buze) with these ingredients:

* 5 liters of funk
* a teaspoon of hiphop lyrics ('rippin up sound')
* 3 kg of loop startpoint-madness (check the buildup) using `btdsys stutter` buzz-plugin 
* 4 spoons of funk synthrecordings I did on my yamaha dx27
* some nice compressors like 'lunar compressor2' built by ld0d
* snappy hihats which turn into whitenoise thanks to ld0d's 'ld hihat'
