<h1>new midicontroller!</h1><br>whoohoo finally my midicontroller is here. This baby will be my ultimate tool  while making livesets. For the people who are not familiar with this stuff: with this i make/design my own funkmusicspaceship for live usage. Instead of using conventional dj turntables, i try to really 'make' my own music in the moment.
I needed lots of sliders to do what i want to do..only thing left to do is lots of configuration!
