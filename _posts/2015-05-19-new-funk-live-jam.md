This is my most recent funk explosion on the Electribe.
After years of funk and house, I still can't get enough of those minimal grooves with carefully placed funkstabs.

I hope this gets our juices flowing as well!

## Live

All sounds come directly from one hardware sampler (the electribe ESX).
This is how music was made back in the past..and present!
No laptop, no external fx, no eq, no plugins.
Just a pair of FUNK ears & hands.
