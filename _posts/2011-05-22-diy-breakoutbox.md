<h1>DIY breakoutbox</h1><br>Every men has an urge to 'fix' or 'make' stuff. Some men have it with their car, some with their house, some in their garden, and..ofcoarse some with their computer.<br>Here's what I just NEEDED tot make urgently:<br><img style="width: 264px; height: 353px;" class="img-align-left" alt="DIY breakoutbox" src="http://www.leondustar.nl/img/1_photo1.JPG" align="left"><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>As you can see it has a jack-in, and XLR-in connector, which is connected to my EMU0404 PCI soundcard. Now I can just plugin instruments after years of doing a special 'snake' exercise behind my computer.<br><br><h2>A breakoutbox in 2011?</h2>
<br>
Yes, even with all the great nowadays USB soundinterfaces. Because when you have a desktopsystem which is really a winnersystem: protect it. <br>I refuse to change a winning team, I will&nbsp; explain why:<br><br>Years ago, I read an interview with <a target="_blank" title="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_%28musical_project%29">Michael Cretu</a> (great producer), where he stated he was using really outdated software and hardware. His motivation was 'never change a winning team'.<br><br><h2>Never change a winning team</h2><br>So here you have a producer who gets admired and interviewed by boys with all the latest toys, But the reality is, it are not the toys, its the person behind the toys.<br>Ok that was Michael, so..back to me: <br><br>I started making digital music in '94 with amiga's, PC's and&nbsp; some midi hardware.<br>The road to where I am now, has been cluttered with bad-latency soundinterface experiences. Sometimes it was the hardware, or driver, or operating system.<br>Also, sometimes upgrading one thing/OS/soundcard, triggers a whole chain of other incompatiblity terror.<br>Conclusion: if you have a setup that works: KEEP IT (and make music).<br>Technology nowadays is evolving fast! So that means innovation is overshadowing backwards compatibility.<br><br><h2>Hommage to the EMU0404</h2><br>I have had no problems with this guy on linux, windows xp and windows 7. <br>The latency is even tighter then my <a target="_blank" title="native instruments audio kontrol 1" href="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar07/articles/niaudiokontrol.htm">Native Instruments Audio Kontrol USB interface</a>.<br>Since my EMU0404 PCI is so stable: I will fall for 'hey..lets upgrade this/that'. Because it is just TOO risky.<br>Before you know you are not able to make music :)<br><br><br>
