There's something about mp3 what I like, and many others don't like: transientsmear. When drums are compressed with (lofi) mp3, pre-echo's are introduced. I like that. (I dont like the dynamics-loss of the transients, but I like pre-echo's).

Why I like pre-echo's
----------------------


  


Pre-echo's, especially on drums give smooth transients, instead of harsh transient. I call it 'fluffy beats'. Ever listened to 60/70's music? Many folks out there are fiddling with audiotransformers, or especially buy an old mixingdisk with their favourite audiotransformers. Audiotransformers usually (depending on the type) introduce transientleakage/smear too. However, the dynamics of the transients are usually better preserved (compared to (lofi) mp3).

  

Compression is for kids
-----------------------


  


This is a quote I actually heard the technician of Quincy Jones saying which really made me think.

Compressors, my favourite gem of the past, are known to easily 'massage' transients into something else. Well, depending on what kind of music your after..I nowadays prefer to use hardware tubes for limiting (JJ tubes on my electribe ESX) and try to stay away from too much pluginstuff and/or compression. Its just so easy to get carried away in nothing. The good thing is that I learned to apply, make, and use compressors fairly well thruout the years. However for many other things, layering transient(samples) can phatten things up much easier.

  

My search for pre-echo's
-------------------------


  


I tried many pre-echo plugins, phase vocoders and other fft plugins hunting for the 'pre-echo' on drums. I even wrote my own plugins, and tried many phasevocoder-sourcecode (provided by universities e.g.). All of them suffered the same problem: **pre-echo loss of dynamics of the transient itself**. I tried many things, mixing them with the origin signal etc. However this lead to many other problems I will not get into.

  

The solution
------------


  


The solution was quite simple (ofcoarse). Instead of processing *everything* and losing things in the process, I decided to things myself. The solution was a simple reversed shaker sound :D

The reversed shaker sound used as a pre-echo on my electribe does the job perfectly..it introduces the pre-echo, and the drumsounds maintain their punchy transient.

  

Example: without pre-echo
