Lately I realized it: I have a dreamstudio.


I've been really satisfied with my dreamsetup: [Buze](http://batman.no/buze/\" "\"\"") (a modular multiplugin-DAW), and [LD Mixer](http://buzzmachines.com/machineinfo.php?id=921\" "\"\"") (a modular multi-in/out mixer plugin).

Since this software is free, I want to give something back: my mixer skin!

Well..'my' is a big word, I modified okapi/moon.god's skin :D

Logic/Ableton/Cubase workflow in buze?
--------------------------------------

This is why I like buze. It already has the flexible multi-input/output routing, native controller plugins & Ableton-like envelopes in the pattern editor. Together with this mixer its the bomb. Read more about buze [here](http://batman.no/buze). 

Why is this mixer so great?
---------------------------

Its very modular and flexible..you can freely assign zillions inputs/outputs to any aux/channel/group. Finally something which comes close to an Ableton/Logic/Cubase-mixer. Luckily, this time the mixer can also benefit from the possibilities of a modulair DAW.


goodbye:
--------

* pre-delay and post-delay plugins
* eq plugins
* panning plugins
* gain plugins
* audio analyzer plugins

welcome ld mixer, meaning:
--------------------------
  
* stability: replacing many plugins by one stable plugin
* router (multi-in multi-out)
* playing/recording wav-bounces
* flexible pre/post audiodelay for sample and live playback
* channel meters
* more cpu
* hasslefree midi controller
* cubase/ableton/logic workflow (buze envelopes ldmixer)

> UPDATE: nowadays Buze has an internal (modular) mixer and now I prefer it over ld mixer
