title: CARLA a dream studiorack
---
Remember reason? It gives you that feeling of owning gear and patching cables.

Well, after a long software-break, I decided to check out Carla (on Linux).
And I have to say I'm impressed!

Finally a KISS pluginhost with *multi-platform* plugin-support:

* ladspa plugins
* lv2 plugins
* dssi synth plugins
* linux vst plugins
* win32 vst plugins
* win64 vst plugins
* native soundfont support (.sfz .sf2 and .gig)
* python rdf

## One soft-studio rack

Finally one central place to organize all my soft-gear, my crossplatform wish has been granted!
A portable soft-studio which can be fed midi and audio by anything.

## Sequence as you wish

You can use carla as you wish:

* as a standalone midi sending/receiving soft-studio (using hardware midi seq)
* as a plugin in DAWS

I hope it will somehow support changing patches using midi program change message.
Would be cool to change studiorack setups using your outboard midi gear.

## How I plan to use CARLA

Im curious if this tool will make me sit more often in front of a computer.
As stated before in articles, these days I dislike sequencing songs in DAW's.
I would love to use CARLA as a instrument interface connected to my hardware midi sequencer.
Especially the native soundfont support finally allows me to organize my soundfont instrumentcollection.
We'll see :)
