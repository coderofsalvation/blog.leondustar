Born Digital operates as an art assembly of electronic media artists.

Its different roots trace back to the early nineties. Producing electronic music and visuals have been daytime activities for most of the five 

initiators since the early Internet era. The fruits of their work have 

always been spread and shared by digital networks. 

Born Digital originally existed of five independent production companies and art labels. In the summer of 2008 all came together in one foundation for New Media & New Creativity.

 

In november 2009 Born Digital organized a weekend of new media art exhibitions, presentations and performances as part of the Kultursonntage Niemandsland. During this weekend Utrecht celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall, now 20 years ago. This video contains a summary of the events, with a variety of artists showcasing ‘Utrecht meets Berlin’.
