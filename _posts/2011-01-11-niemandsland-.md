<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Born Digital operates as an art assembly of electronic media artists.</p><p>Its
different roots trace back to the early nineties. Producing electronic
music and visuals have been daytime activities for most of the five&nbsp;</p><p>initiators since the early Internet era. The fruits of their work have&nbsp;</p><p>always been spread and shared by digital networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Born
Digital originally existed of five independent production companies and
art labels. In the summer of 2008 all came together in one foundation
for New Media &amp; New Creativity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In november 2009 Born
Digital organized a weekend of new media art exhibitions, presentations
and performances as part of the Kultursonntage Niemandsland. During
this weekend Utrecht celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall, now 20
years ago. This video contains a summary of the events, with a variety
of artists showcasing &lsquo;Utrecht meets Berlin&rsquo;.</p>
