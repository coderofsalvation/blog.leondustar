title: electribe sx dithering distortion trick
---

The Korg electribe SX native distortion effect lacks treble crips imho. 
I accidentally discovered how to add high distortion frequencies: by maximizing the added dithering: normalize a sample played at low volume.
Doing so with the eq-effect will give you still a bit of high- low-band control using the fx knobs.

## Summary

Just go into sample mode an:

* apply an eq fx
* set the level around 11-14
* resample the sound (shift+record and hit a drumpad)
* normalize (shift+ normalize button)

There you go, dither dirt is added!
