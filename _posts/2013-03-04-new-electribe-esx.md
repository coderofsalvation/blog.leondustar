<h1>new electribe esx</h1><br>The package has arrived! A new old korg electribe esx with JJ tubes. What a beast! Next liveset will be done with this great tool. Actually I'm quite surprised, its pretty well suited for quick soundengineering as well (easy sampling back an forth from/to PC, and easy handon effects). Big ups for Korg!<div><br></div><div><img src="http://www.leondustar.nl/img/electribeesx.jpg" alt="korg electribe" style="width:250px" align="left" class="img-align-left"></div>
