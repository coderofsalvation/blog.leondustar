title: new electribe esx
---
The package has arrived! A new old korg electribe esx with JJ tubes. What a beast! Next liveset will be done with this great tool. Actually I'm quite surprised, its pretty well suited for quick soundengineering as well (easy sampling back an forth from/to PC, and easy handon effects). Big ups for Korg!
