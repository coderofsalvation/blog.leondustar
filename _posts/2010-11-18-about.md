The fans of Leon Du Star are known to be the most friendliest, and funkiest people on earth. You are now also one of them. Thank you.  
  



PRODUCER
--------

Leon's love for producing & releasing electronic music is infinite.

The 'Close to you'-release even reached the topseller chart on www.dancerecords.com, and was being touted by many as a great 'Daft Punk Anthem'.

But releasing music is just a manifestation which derives from his studio practices.Â 

In the studio he becomes one with his guitar, synthesizers,percussion instruments and converts it into one compact sound.

He knows there is no difference between using a djembe or using subliminal musicsoftware / equipment.

His productions are his kungfu, and he has worked with a lot of masters.
