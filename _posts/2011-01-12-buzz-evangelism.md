title: buzz evangelism

Once in a while we have to do a bit of software evangelism. For productions we like many software: Cubase, Wavelab, plugins and also [Buzz](http://www.buzzmachines.com/).  
![buzz theme DAW Leon Du Star]({{ site.baseurl }}/public/img/brutix_small_med.jpg)  
  
[Buzz](http://www.buzzmachines.com/) is the first modular digital audio environment, which developed a pluginformat even before Steinberg came up with the wonderfull VST format.  
  
Its more friendly on the CPU then the commercial DAW's like Ableton/Cubase (you can use more plugs), against the price of the userface being less fancy.  
Every task is ergonomically facilitated by a keyboardshortcut, so you can lay back with your keyboard, and compose tracks!
